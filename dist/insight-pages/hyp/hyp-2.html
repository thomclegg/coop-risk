        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A need for the whole risk team to finalise the risk framework and all agree it</li>
          <li>The most suitable location for it (intranet, internet, within a software system itself, paper, via F2F/ e-training)</li>
          <li>It needs to be accessible at the point of need</li>
          <li>Risk Colleagues may not need to use the whole framework directly, consider additional ways to make it meaningful</li>
          <li>Real examples would help people</li>
          <li>This should apply to all people who deal with risk, including ‘side of deskers’</li>
          <li>It needs to be communicated clearly, using the language your users use</li>
          <li>It needs to involve the user in the design to identify a consistent role set and description</li>
          <li>Could users help provide examples and case studies, especially if it’s a living thing?</li>
