        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep it simple and see if tools are available to do it, we don’t need to buy anything (Slack works well in Digital)</li>
          <li>BPs should be visible in there for assurance, support and to see how users and finding things</li>
          <li>Experiment with structure, is it face to face, lunch etc?</li>
          <li>Is it somewhere that could be run as a community of practice, for example getting feedback on stuff, or occasional f2f group discussions? Workshops?</li>
          <li>Needs to be a safe space, we should encourage honesty and avoid a ‘blame’ culture</li>
          <li>Use something like the retro prime directive:
            <h3>"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."</h3>
          </li>
