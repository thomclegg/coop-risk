        <ul>
          <li>Think about outcomes not solutions, people don’t want a complex calculation, they want information and assurance. What does the calculation give them?</li>
          <li>More work is needed to identify what ‘calculations’ people need performing</li>
          <li>Consider how information is presented so that people can understand it</li>
          <li>It needs to be communicated clearly, <strong>using the language your users use</strong></li>
          <li>It should be iterated, tested and improved</li>
          <li>Ensure accessibility is considered</li>
