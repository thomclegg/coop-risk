      <h1 class="on-light">Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Risk Management team had reached a point where they were unsure whether to invest in a Co-op wide risk management software product. The uncertainty was whether it would really solve the challenges the team face in improving how collectively
        the Co-op manages risk. They requested support from Digital who placed a small team on the 5th floor Angel Square. The team was;</p>

      <h1 class="on-light">Week 1</h1>
      <h2>Inception</h2>
      <p>We spent a few hours on Monday and Tuesday with the Heads of Risk and members the Transformation team. We went through a few exercises aiming to reach a shared understanding of what we’re looking to achieve over the next four weeks.</p>
      <h2>Team canvas</h2>
      <p>We used a team canvas to capture the outputs of the sessions, the first of which was an articulation of our purpose.</p>
      <p>Our agreed purpose being...</p>
      <h3>Provide insights and recommendations that helps the Risk Management Team take their next steps</h3>
      <h2>Assumptions and pain points</h2>
      <p>We mapped out some scenarios of the ways different risk types are managed. We then identified assumptions and pain-points. We then gathered these together which gave us a view on some common problems that we could focus on.</p>
      <h2>Our focus</h2>
      <p>We saw three things we could help with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find out what those responsible in business units and enabling functions need to help improve the overall management of risk</li>
        <li>Understand the level of awareness of the importance of managing risk amongst those responsible</li>
        <li>Understand the level of awareness of the importance in enabling ‘One Co-op’ wide management of risk</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Interviews</h2>
      <p>Once we had our focus we could work out who we wanted to talk to first. We spent some time with each of the business risk partners and have managed to interview a handful of people in business units and enabling functions already. </p>
      <h2>Early observations</h2>
      <p>It’s too early to derive much from the interviews so far, but we have picked up a few things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A system would enable better management of risk, but that whole system isn’t necessarily a single piece of software.</li>
        <li>The needs of Risk Inputters, Owners and Controllers were not fully understood as part of the requirements gathering for an electronic risk management system.</li>
        <li>Risk seems to be well understood and managed within business areas and enabling functions.</li>
        <li>The Risk Register spreadsheet is hard to use.</li>
        <li>The common ‘One Co-op’ related challenge of changing local ways of working to benefit the whole Co-op seems to be the case here too.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="on-light">Week 2</h1>
      <h2>Interviews and analysis</h2>
      <p>Simon has now done 15 interviews. We have 5 left in our diaries for the next couple days, we’ll most likely talk to more people before we’re finished. The output from the sessions are notes, quotes and observations captured on post-its. Matt has
        done the majority of the note taking, but Daniel has also been helping too, which is a great help. The post-its are then grouped and analysed. Here’s what that looks like at the moment:</p>
      <p>We’ll make sense of this, understand the needs of Risk Colleagues when it comes to managing their risks.</p>
      <p>‘Risk Colleagues’ are those within business units and enabling functions who have some responsibility in capturing and managing risks. They are the Risk Business Partner’s ‘clients’.</p>
      <h2>Mapping business partners processes</h2>
      <p>Zirca and Tom have been working with Chris, Jamie and Hannah (Risk Business Partners) to understand how they tailor what they need to do for the different areas of the business they partner with. </p>
      <p>From this we are looking for pain-points and common patterns that will reinforce what we’re learning from the Risk Colleague interviews.</p>
      <p>The mapping looks like this:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <h2>Stakeholder / Interview review</h2>
      <p>We took some time out to check that we have sufficiently covered enough of the business, seeing people with differing levels of risk management responsibilities.</p>
      <p>We’ve done pretty well, we still need to talk to folks from Property and Insurance.</p>
      <p>It is common that after a few qualitative interviews you can put a survey together to get a more quantitative view, and that is the case here. Simon has put together a draft survey which has been reviewed by the core risk management team, once we’ve added their builds we’ll test it with a couple people. Once we’re happy it works, we’ll send it to all Risk Colleagues.</p>
      <h2>Our potential outputs</h2>
      <p>We are halfway through our discovery. At this point we spent some time thinking about what our outputs could be, outputs that help achieve our purpose. This is predominantly a user research piece of work so a findings report will be one of our outputs, we will also find a framework that makes it clearer on how the Risk team can plan their next steps based on the insights and user needs.</p>
      <h2>User needs and insights</h2>
      <p>We’ll create some artifacts that clearly show the user needs we identify alongside insights related to those needs. Artifact ideas:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <h2>Observations and recommendations</h2>
      <p>We’ll not become Risk experts in 4 weeks, but we are able to bring a fresh perspective on how the team are managing their transition to a better way of managing risk across The Co-op. So, we’ll write these down as we go along and offer them as one of outputs.</p>

      <h1 class="on-light">Week 3</h1>
      <h2>Finished first round of interviews</h2>
      <p>Earlier this week we finished the first round of interviews. This has enabled us to spot enough of a pattern to create the questions for the survey. It has also given us dozens more observations and quotes to fold into our analysis.</p>
      <p>We are going to continue interviewing next week, making sure we have covered as many areas as possible. We’ll feed any new observations into the analysis.</p>
      <h2>Survey finalised and sent out</h2>
      <p>As mentioned in last week’s notes, the survey will lend some quantitative support (or not) to our interview observations. Last week we collected feedback on the questions we wanted to ask. As soon as an available login came free for the only safe survey tool that we can use, Simon built the survey. As usual it was tested with a few people first, so we could fix any issues with the routing and any typos. We then shared it with the Risk Management team who gave us some final enhancements (thanks for doing this so quickly) then we sent it to around a hundred Co-op risk Risk Colleagues.</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <h2>Analysis of interviews and workshops</h2>
      <p>This is the hard part. We now need to turn everything that we’ve heard and learnt into something that the Risk Management team can make sense of and use to inform what they do next.</p>
      <p>This activity is predominantly Simon anlysing a wall of post-its, summarising, grouping and theming, un-grouping and un-theming...until he gets to a point where our observations become insights. This is a real skill of a user researcher, and he’ll be continuing to this early next week.</p>
      <p>The other output from this analysis will be a set of defined user needs, these are also starting to take shape, we’ve grouping them by functional and motivational needs:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <h2>Refined a potential output</h2>
      <p>We found that our first pass at Risk Colleague experience map was too detailed and would not clarify our insights. So we simplified it:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <p>We’ve mapped the top two swim-lanes (the tasks, tool and techniques that currently happen). It’s very wide, here’s a screenshot of what it looks like:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <p>We’ll park this for now, until we have the insights to map onto it. We’ll then decide with the Risk Management team whether it does the job we want it to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <h1 class="on-light">Week 4</h1>
      <h2>Finished analysis interviews</h2>
      <p>We have spent over 40 hours analysing the observations (post its) that we gathered from the interviews. We used them to draft insights, then we took a step back, unpicked them again and repeated until we had a set of insights that we felt were clear and ‘usable’.</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <p>These insights shouldn’t be set in stone, they are our interpretations of what we have observed at this point in time.</p>
      <p>We’ve also mapped the survey results and Business Partner observations to these insights.</p>
      <h2>User Research Findings v1 ready to share</h2>
      <p>This is the first of our key outputs. This discovery has primarily been user research and from that you’d expect a document that shares what we learnt.</p>
      <p>We’re sharing this with the core team to start with, but it will be shared more widely by the end of next week. As a taster, here are some of the user needs that we saw:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <h2>Hypotheses and web pages</h2>
      <p>We’ve working on how to make the research findings more usable, something that helps the Risk Management team tackle the challenges that we’ve seen, in other words ‘take their next steps’ as stated in our purpose.</p>
      <p>The first thing we’re going to do is create a set of hypotheses from the insights and goal oriented scenario detail, looking something like this:</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
      <p>We’ve decided to organise our findings across a set of interlinked web-pages. THIS IS NOT A RISK WEBSITE!! It’s just something that makes it easier to navigate our outputs and focus activity on fixing the issues that our insights highlight - all based around the context of meeting user needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <h1 class="on-light">Week 5</h1>
      <p>Due to other existing commitments in the previous four weeks, we added a fifth week to make up for the missed time.</p>
      <h2>Mapped insight to a Goal Oriented Scenario</h2>
      <p>This is the framework that we decided to use to help the team organise the insights and users needs. The scenario is a description of what they want Risk Colleagues and Business Partners to be doing in two years time. We then mapped where the insights sit in relation to this scenario.</p>
      <p>We then ran a workshop with the Risk Team to add more detail to what happens in this scenario, this looked like this:</p>
