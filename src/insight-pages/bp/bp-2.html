          <h4>People assume risk is more exotic and technical than it really is (framework does nothing to change this opinion)</h4>
          <h4>A lot of time is spent hand holding through the process.</h4>
          <h4>They input data into the group risk version of the risk register on their behalf</h4>

          <h4>They don't have enough time for oversight and challenge due to the hand holding required</h4>
          <h4>If we didnâ€™t do this the quality of the data would be so low, as to be not worth analysing</h4>
