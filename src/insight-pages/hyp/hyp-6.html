        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Think about outcomes not solutions, people don’t want a report, they want information and assurance. The report is one possible solution</li>
          <li>More work is needed to identify what information people need access to</li>
          <li>Consider the impact on trust and relationships if people’s work is more visible, encourage openness, don’t blame</li>
          <li>Consider how information is presented so that people can understand it</li>
          <li>It needs to be communicated clearly, using the language your users use</li>
          <li>It should be iterated, tested and improved</li>
          <li>Ensure accessibility is considered</li>
