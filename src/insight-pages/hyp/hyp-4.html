        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All users, BPs, to side of desk inputters, don’t just speak to the ‘yes people’ or the same people, get a range. Consider that some people have disabilities that may impact how they use or interpret technology and information</li>
          <li>You need to act on what is said and feed it back to people, otherwise they will feel ignored</li>
          <li>Ensure you’re understanding what people need, not what they say they want</li>
          <li>Select suppliers or partners who will buy into this way of working</li>
          <li>BPs spend half a day every six weeks with an end user to understand how they work</li>
